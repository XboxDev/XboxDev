# XboxDev

XboxDev is the place for all original Xbox projects to come together.

XboxDev is an effort to provide tools and documentation for the original Microsoft Xbox and Xbox-based SEGA Chihiro.
We not only care about technical details about those platforms, but also how to develop homebrew and emulate them.

We are not interested in documenting the Xbox 360, Xbox One or any other console at this point.

You can [create an issue to contact XboxDev maintainers](https://github.com/XboxDev/XboxDev/issues/new).
